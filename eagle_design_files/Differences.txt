## Differences between V1.4 and V1.3R

PSU: 
  - C6/C7 (output capacitors on 9 Volt rails) marked as "Low ESR"

CPU:
  - Protection diode on VDC sample line 
  - Pull up resistor on RESET line

Input stage:
  - Wire up second OpAmp of U4 correctly, as a follower (otherwise unused)

Output stage:
  - MAX548 eliminated
  - R30 (current sense) reduced to 0.27 Ohm
  - Transformer types changed to 42TU200 (different footprint)

Display print: 
  - Resistor in series with LED in LCD changed to 100 Ohm
  - Moved connector to behind LCD (shorter cable)


## Differences V1.3B / V1.3R:

PSU:
  - reverse polarity diode (D4)
  - 2 power connector headers for 12 V (JP3, JP4)
  
  
CPU: no differences found

Front panel: no differences found

Input stage:
  - Extra filtering on microphone input (electret power); biasing of OpAmp input
  - Extra "AUX Line in" connector

Output stage: no differences found
