Board revisions:

December 2022: 1.4.2-Chi

- Increased clearance around tracks to primary side of transformers
- Fixed annotations for R37/R38 and R48/R49 on Fab layer
- Fixed size of mounting holes for LCD
- Moved LCD window on front panel

September2022: 1.4.1-Chi

- Fixed footprint for powerbus connector

August 2022: 1.3.1-Chi

- Fixed mounting holes for display print, re-aligned LCD module.
- Tiny adjustment on mainboard for one 3.5 mm jack

August 2022: 1.3-Chi

- Converted 1.3R Eagle designs into KiCad
- Split displayboard from main PCB
- Moved a few components a tiny bit on main PCB to make room for some
  annotations

No components were added or altered. Most standard components have been
converted to KiCad versions, except a few mechanical parts like buttons,
transformers, audio jacks and switches.

Component numbers have of course changed due to the split.

MK-312BT V1.4 05-19-2019 

Noteable design changes:

Board reconfigured to allow 42TU200 transformers, 42TL004 still useable by bending the wires slightly during insertion.

U4B (Mic Preamp) reconfigured as recommended by TI application for an unused op-amp section.

J10 repositioned on display panel for much shorter ribbon cable.

U8A/U8B changed to U8 for LTC1661 

R63 10K added to reset line of ATMEGA.

C6 and C7 repositioned to allow better spacing from regulators.

D5 1N4148 added to DC input line for additional protection to ATMEGA incase wrong polarity power supply.


Recommendations:

C6 and C7 should be Low ESR type electrolytics.

When using 42TU200 Transformers, if higher output current is desired use 0.27 Ohm for R30, and 680uF-820uF for C6 and C7.
42TU200 transformers were tested and known to work with 0.5, 0.30 and 0.27 ohm resistors at R30.

R55 recommended 100 - 220 ohm for LCD backlight as it is a single LED in New Haven displays. 

J2-J7 can be replaced by STX-3100-5N, same part minus the plastic back cover.  https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Kycon/STX-3100-5N
