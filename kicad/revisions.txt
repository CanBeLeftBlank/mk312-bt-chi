August 2022: 1.3-Chi

- Converted 1.3R Eagle designs into KiCad
- Split displayboard from main PCB
- Moved a few components a tiny bit on main PCB to make room for some
  annotations

No components were added or altered. Most standard components have been
converted to KiCad versions, except a few mechanical parts like buttons,
transformers, audio jacks and switches.

Component numbers have of course changed due to the split.
